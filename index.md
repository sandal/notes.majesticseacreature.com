# What is this thing?

This isn't really a website, and it's not really a blog. It's more-or-less a
place that allows me to share ad-hoc notes via the interwebs.

The notes stored here will mostly be random thoughts and essays, along
with whatever other miscellaneous things I feel likje sharing.

If you want to track when updates are made to this website, check out its
[repository 
on Github](http://github.com/sandal/notes.majesticseacreature.com). 


If you want to discuss something with me, you can [email
me](mailto:gregory.t.brown@gmail.com).
