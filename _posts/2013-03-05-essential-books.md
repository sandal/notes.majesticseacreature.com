# {{ page.title }}

I read a ton of miscellaneous non-fiction books, mostly on business, psychology,
and Buddhism. While many have given me something to think about, these ones
stand out for really challenging me to look at myself and my work in a very
different light:

* Seeking the Heart of Wisdom (Goldstein / Kornfield)
* Thinking, Fast and Slow (Kahneman)
* The Penguin and the Leviathan (Benkler)
* The Power of Habit (Duhigg)
* How to Win Friends and Influence People (Carnegie)
* What Got You Here Won't Get You There (Goldsmith)
* The Design of Everyday Things (Norman)
* The First Five Pages (Lukeman)
* Anything You Want (Sivers)
* The Meditator's Workbook (Flickstein)
* A First Course in Topology (Conover)

I haven't included link for the above, because I don't want to necessarily
encourage you to buy these books from a particular place. I also haven't
included reviews, because they've all influenced me in a very personal
way. But I can wholeheartedly recommend them to you, and if you read
them (or have already read them), you're welcome 
to [email me](mailto:gregory.t.brown@gmail.com) if you want to discuss
them further.
