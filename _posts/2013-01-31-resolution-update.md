# {{ page.title }}

Last year I managed to successfully stick to the spirit of my New Year's
resolution, for the first time in my life. Cursed by that success, I'm
making a serious attempt at a repeat experience in 2013. This is a quick
progress report mainly for my own sake, to remind me of what I am trying
to stick to.

This year, I have two resolutions, one very specific, and the other very 
vague. The vague resolution is to simply avoid feeling "busy" as much as possible,
and so far that has worked out. I've taken way more time off in the last 
month than I typically would, and my work has not suffered at all because
of it (in fact, I've produced MORE than I usually would).

The more specific resolution is meant to help encourage me to really work when
I'm working, really play when I'm playing, and really relax when I'm relaxing.
To that end, I've asked myself to avoid screen-based entertainment Mondays
through Thursdays (except holidays and other special occasions). So far, my
progress on that goal has been mixed.

This resolution has made it easy for me to avoid watching TV or playing video
games on weeknights, so much so that I've had a 100% success rate with that so
far. I do play some games or watch TV on the weekends, but those activities
can't compete with much more interesting ones such as spending time with friends and
going out and actually *doing* something, so they tend to just fill up the time
when I'm not doing those things. This is great, because it has broken up my
habits enough that I don't miss TV or video games at all during the weekdays.

Restricting my weeknight computer use is much, much more complicated. For
example, I consider writing this update something worthwhile to do, and I also
think doing a bit of recreational programming or studying could be considered
worthwhile. Some of my evenings are also spent doing Skype chats, which also
seem wholesome enough. None of these are the kinds of activities I'm looking to
ban, because they all enrich me in some way. But once I physically sit down at
the keyboard, it's all too easy to dip into my email, to check some updates on
twitter, or to unblock Reddit / HN and really go to town on some mindless
clicking. I could name a hundred other sources of distraction, but I'm sure you
get the idea -- these are the things I'm trying to get away from!

No matter what, the removal of TV and video games has done a lot for me during
the week. Some nights I'm not in the mood for internet hijinx, so I will
actually try to cook something, or read a book, or do something else that's
genuinely relaxing. Other nights, I do get caught up on the computer, but I get
bored of that stuff quickly enough that it's somewhat self-limiting, and so I've
found myself going to sleep much earlier.

Still, I feel like I spend a big chunk of my time doing "fake relaxation"
activities on the internet that leaves me feeling exhausted, particularly on my 
days off. In my original resolution, I mentioned that if I couldn't keep this
kind of stuff under control I'd consider simply pulling the plug after a certain
time of day. I'm not quite there yet, but I'm teetering on the edge.

For now, what I'm going to try to do (on weekdays only) is to have a plan for
what I am going to use the computer for BEFORE I sit down and start doing stuff.
This should help me use it in a more meaningful way, and with fewer
distractions. I'll try this throughout February and see if it helps, and if it
doesn't... more harsh methods will need to be put into place.

Anyway, that's my progress so far. Kind of a little ramble, not that
interesting, but honest at least.
