Going to keep this one brief.

Throughout March, I was stressed towards the beginning of the month, but took a
lot of time off throughout the rest of the month. That made me less busy, but I
was also sick for about 10 days. So... I watched a *ton* of TV, played a lot of
video games (Tropico), and spent a huge chunk of time mindlessly 
browsing the web.

So umm... this month was too chaotic to analyze. Let's see how April goes!
