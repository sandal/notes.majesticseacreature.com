# {{ page.title }}

Last year I managed to successfully stick to the spirit of my New Year's
resolution, for the first time in my life. Cursed by that success, I'm
making a serious attempt at a repeat experience in 2013. This is a quick
progress report mainly for my own sake, to remind me of what I am trying
to stick to. This year, I have two resolutions, one very specific, 
and the other very vague. 

My vague resolution is to simply avoid feeling "busy" as much as 
possible. While I did good job of this in January, February felt much
busier for me. This may have just been due to the writing course I had
to run, or it could have been due to the fact that I was playing catch
up a bit for work that I had hoped to get done in January. In either
case, I noticed that there were a few days where I set goals for myself
that I simply didn't come close to meeting, and that's the main
symptom of the problem I'm trying to avoid. Next month I'll try to make
sure to take more intentional days off to avoid the accidental ones,
and avoid scheduling too much work for myself if possible!

My specific resolution is meant to encourage me to really work when
I'm working, really play when I'm playing, and really relax when I'm relaxing.
To that end, I've asked myself to avoid screen-based entertainment Mondays
through Thursdays (except holidays and other special occasions). So far, my
progress on that goal has been mixed.

Back in the [January
update](http://notes.majesticseacreature.com/2013/01/31/resolution-update.html),
I noted that I had been perfect at dealing with TV and video games, but was
still struggling with my casual internet browsing in the evenings. I suggested
that I'd come up with a plan for how I wanted to use the computer in the evening
in advance hoping that would help, but I just couldn't force myself into
that habit.

Other concerns are cropping up too. For example: my current schedule doesn't
really leave me time to play games or watch TV shows and movies that my wife
doesn't like. During the work week, I abstain from them entirely, but on the
weekend, I want to spend time with her and so I don't find time for them. I
think the solution to this might be to give myself some freedom to do whatever I
want whenever my days off fall during the weekdays (which happens fairly often,
due to my irregular schedule), so I'm going to experiment with that and see how
it goes.

I promised myself that I'd take a stronger stance towards my weeknight internet
use if I couldn't get it under control, and so I plan to do that in March. I'm
thinking of simply unplugging my laptop around 4pm or 5pm, giving myself one
laptop battery to last the night. That should help self-limit things a bit, and
is worth a shot for any night that I didn't specifically block off as a work
night on a particular project.

I'll be honest: I hate doing these status updates, because this year's
resolution is clearly much harder for me than last year's. However, catching a
glimpse of the positive impacts it can have on my life has made me want to keep
working -- at least for another month!
