# {{ page.title }}

Despite so many years of progress, most of the internet is still one big ghost
town. Things fall apart faster than we can maintain them, and so we can never stay
tied down in any one place for too long.

We can try to fight this all we want, but the results are always the same: what
was once a bustling frontier town becomes an abandoned settlement, full of
nothing but tumbleweeds and dust.

Maybe its time we resign to the fact that we're never going to be able to tame
the wild web, and that we're forever destined to roam.
